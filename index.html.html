<h2>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</h2>
<p>Main article: Symptoms of COVID-19
Symptoms of COVID-19
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to critical and
possibly fatal illness.[34][35] Common symptoms include coughing, fever, loss of
smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia), with less common ones including headaches,
nasal congestion and runny nose, muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, eye
irritation,[36] and toes swelling or turning purple,[37] and in moderate to severe
cases breathing difficulties.[38] People with the COVID-19 infection may have
different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters
of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough,
sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with
muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with
abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[38] In people without prior ear, nose, and
throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with
COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.[39][40][41]
Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to
mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than
50% lung involvement on imaging) which requiring hospitalization and 5% of patients
suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiorgan
dysfunction) requiring ICU admission.[42] At least a third of the people who are
infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in
time.[43][44] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can still
spread the disease.[44][45][46][47] Other infected people will develop symptoms
later, called "pre-symptomatic ", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the
virus.[47]
As is common with infections,
<hr />
there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the
appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five
days[48] possibly being infectious on 1-4 of those days.[49] Most symptomatic
people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all
will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[48][50]
Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people –
over half of a cohort of home-isolated young adults[51][52] – continue to
experience a range of effects, such as fatigue, for months even after recovery, a
condition called long COVID; long-term damage to organs has been observed.
Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the potential long-term
effects of the disease.[53]
Cause.COVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by
droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus. Infected
people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or
sing.[55][56][57][58] Transmission is more likely the more physically close people
are. However, infection can occur over
<hr />
longer distances, particularly indoors.[55][59]
Infectivity can begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms,[60]
although contact tracing typically begins only two to three days before symptom
onset.[61] Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic
or asymptomatic.[61] Most commonly, the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract
samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week
after symptoms begin.[61] Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding
and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for
people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and a up to 20 days for persons with severe
COVID-19, including immunocompromised people.[62][61]
Infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the
air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne briefly or
fall to the ground.[63][64][65][66]
<hr />
Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of
how respiratory viruses are transmitted.[66][67] The largest droplets of
respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes
on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.[65] Aerosols are highest in concentration
when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when
people are physically close,[65][66][67] but airborne transmission can occur at
longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;[65] in those
conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to
hours.[65]
The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies,[68] but
it is estimated that the R0 ("R nought " or "R zero ") number is around 2.5.[69] The
disease often spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index
case or geographical location.[70] Often in these instances, superspreading events
occur, where many people are infected by one person.[68]</p>
